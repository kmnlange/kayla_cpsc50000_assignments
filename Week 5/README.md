population_explorer.py

Description:
A menu-driven program that reads a CSV file of world population data,
stores the data in a list of dictionaries, and allows users to perform a
case-insensitive country search, view the top and bottom five countries by
2024 population using built-in sorting, and generate a dictionary-based
report of countries grouped by their starting letter. The program runs
until the user chooses to exit.
